# ffm_cpp
C++ code used in the paper:
Zylstra, P., Bradstock, R.A., Bedward, M., Penman, T.D., Doherty, M.D., Weber, R.O., Gill, A.M. &amp; Cary, G.J. 
(2016) Biophysical mechanistic modelling quantifies the effects of plant traits on fire severity: 
species, not surface fuel loads determine flame dimensions in eucalypt forests. PLoS One, 11, e0160715.

The model was originally developed by P. Zylstra as an MS Excel application, and subsequently implemented as a C++ program 
by Chris Thomas. Michael Bedward has further modified the code.
